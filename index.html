                This week, City Council is set to finally hold a full council vote on Mayor Eric Adam’s ‘City of Yes’ zoning plan. The proposed overhaul of the city’s zoning restrictions, which is widely expected to pass, is intended to open the door for a rapid expansion of housing development across the five boroughs. If passed, it would be the most significant change to New York City’s zoning laws since sweeping reforms in 1961 which sought to stop new construction of large buildings and divide the city into separate residential, manufacturing and commercial areas. 
    According to the Citizens Housing & Planning Council, the 1961 zoning reforms are responsible for an 80% reduction in the city’s zoned capacity for housing.

    Data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows a massive drop in new housing supply in the decades following 1961 compared to preceding decades.
    <br>
    <br>
    Included in the mayor and city council’s new plan are significant reductions in parking mandates, $5 billion in housing and infrastructure investments, opening up construction of larger apartment buildings near transit hubs and a broad increase in housing density. The mayor’s office and city council estimate City of Yes will allow for the construction of 80,000 new housing units in the next 15 years.
